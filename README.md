# Foundry Simple Storage

This project demonstrates a basic smart contract for storing and retrieving values on the Ethereum blockchain using the Foundry framework.

## Overview

The Simple Storage contract allows you to:

- Store a single `uint256` value.
- Retrieve the stored value.

This project is structured to help developers understand how to work with smart contracts and the Foundry toolset, while also serving as a foundation for more complex Ethereum-based applications.

## Features

- **Smart Contract:** A Solidity contract that stores and retrieves a value.
- **Unit Testing:** Includes unit tests to ensure the correct behavior of the contract.
- **Gas Reporting:** Analyze gas usage for storage and retrieval operations.
- **Deployment:** Scripts for deploying the contract to Ethereum test networks.

## Prerequisites

To use this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) – A blazing fast Ethereum development framework.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) – For scripting and additional tooling (if needed).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xyzsimon34/Foundry-Simple-Storage.git
   cd Foundry-Simple-Storage
